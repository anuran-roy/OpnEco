## Other features:

1. Hassle-free installation
2. Can work without Internet (some modules need them though.)

## Installation:

OpnEco doesn't require any lengthy installation process. You can do in any of the following ways:

1. You can simply download, resolve its dependencies, and build it. 

2. If you are a Windows user, you can run ```setup.bat``` by double clicking it. If you are a Linux user, a simple ```./setup.sh``` will do.

But ensure that you have a proper Internet connection and Python installed and properly configured. Windows users may need to check if Python is added to the PATH environment variable in their systems.
### Steps (for those who chose to build it):

0. Download this project code and open the top-level directory.
1. Install the Python dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` if you have two versions of Python installed.)
2. Run init.py using ```python init.py``` (or ```python3 init.py``` if you have two versions of Python installed.)
3. Run manage.py using ```python manage.py runserver``` (or ```python3 manage.py runserver``` if you have two versions of Python installed.)

## Starting up:

1. If you are a Windows user, you can run ```start.bat``` by double clicking it. If you are a Linux user, a simple ```./start.sh``` will do.
2. If you built it from scratch, follow steps 0 and 3 above.
3. Open ```127.0.0.1:8000``` or ```localhost:8000``` on your browser if you have installed with default settings.
